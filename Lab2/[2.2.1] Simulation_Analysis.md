	
## In the beginning was the Chaos (En arxi in to xaos).	

At the first round of iterations we decided to implement a
thorough "sensitivity" analysis, by varying all the parameters
one by one, apart from the parameter 7: cache_line_size.

This parameter stands out compared to the others for some reasons.
It is not widely implemented a cache-line size greater than 64 bytes,
not because it isn't effective in terms of speed results, but due to
Hardware restrictions. On the other side, a cache-line size smaller
than 64 bytes doesn't make any sense, since results are quite worse
and now 64 bytes are widely applied.

So, for the 1st Round of Simulations we will keep cache_line_size=64.

For the rest of the parameters we will simulate the following values:

| ranges | I_size | D_size | L2_size | I_assoc | D_assoc | L2_assoc
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 8kB | 8kB | 256kB | 2-way | 2-way | 4-way |
| | 64kB | 64kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way |

The design choices for the first round -which are expressed on
the values' choice- are based on  of the following rationale:

+ Keep L1 caches small and simple:
	+ ignored 128 kB caches for L1, even though it was allowed.
	+ excluded associativity levels greater than 4 for L1.
+ Diagrams prove that for smaller caches (roughly we could say
up to 64 kB), 2-way associativity is better than direct-mapped:
	+ Excluded direct-mapped caches even for L1.
+ As cache_size increases from 64kB 4-way and 8-way associative
caches show better performance:
	+ Excluded direct-mapped and 2-way associative caches for L2.

The only obvious thing so far that is not aligned with the 
current trends of technology is the 8 kB cache for L1 caches,
but is simulated for the scope of this project.

From all the above mentioned values of the parameters, we decided
to simulate ALL the combinations apart from these ones containing
the pair: [Cache_Size=8kB, Cache_Assoc=4].

temp4=$(($I_size / $I_assoc)) AND temp6=$(($D_size / $D_assoc))  
if [ $temp4 -ge 3 ]  
then  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if [ $temp6 -ge 3 ]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fi  
fi  

It doesn't make actually sense having such a high associativity
So, we ended up with 490 combinations.

Normally, this amount of simulations wouldn't be doable before the
deadline, so we decided to run the simulations with 10 times less
instructions and more specifically: 10 million Instructions instead
of 100 million.  
Below, we can see the host_times and simulated_seconds for the
"short" and the "normal" version for some specific parameters per
benchmark:  

| Benchmarks | Bzip_normal | Bzip_short | Hmmer_normal | Hmmer_short | Libm_normal | Libm_short | Mcf_normal | Mcf_short | Sjeng_normal | Sjeng_short |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Host_time(s) | 248.2 | 29.27 | 249.82 | 23.59 | 486.65 | 39.68 | 399.57 | 41.91 | 573.82 | 42.72 |
| Sim_time(s) | 0.085746 | 0.013551 | 0.059429 | 0.006409 | 0.106867 | 0.011428 | 0.056086 | 0.006787 | 0.340096 | 0.019735

Since the simulated time is considered enough for the short versions
as well and the gain in the host_time is critical for the success of
the project, we will proceed with these.
So, let the instructions of the simulation be: 10000000

## Crossing the Data-Ocean

After creating this chaos of data to evaluate, we decided to use
the RStudio to analyze it and pre-process it. This decision was driven
by the convenience this interface provides in order to analyze
statistical data and this was what we had.

The plan was simple:  
Identify the Best, and take them with you (reference to Argonaut Campaign).  
For each Benchmark and for the best values, we will run the Second Round of
Simulations.
But, how are the best values identified and selected?  
Check the following  
+ R_Scripts that generate:
+ Figures

_Notation to be followed_:
+ Best are the simulations that have the minimum CPI
+ Pass are the simulations that have CPI inside 1st Quartile of CPIs

The outcomes for each Benchmark:  

### Benchmark 429.mcf
Best: 76
Pass:121

Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:

+ I Cache Size should most probably be at least 32 kB.
+ D Cache Size should   definitely  be at least 32 kB.
+ L2 Cache Size should  definitely  be at least  2 MB.
+ I Cache Associativity  doesn't have clear impact.
+ D Cache Associativity  doesn't have clear impact.
+ L2 Cache Associativity doesn't have clear impact.

| ranges | I_size | D_size | L2_size | I_assoc | D_assoc | L2_assoc | cache_line_size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 64kB | 64kB | 2MB | 2-way | 2-way | 4-way | 128bytes |
| | 128kB | 128kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way | 256bytes |

Explanation: For the L1 Cache Sizes we see similar results between
caches of size 32 and 64 kB. Since they are the greater values we
simulated we will choose the bigger one for the next round and also
simulate the benchmarks for cache size 128 kB.  
In case it is needed, the simulations will be repeated for 32 kB L1
cache size and higher cache_line_size, but with specific configs now.

### Benchmark 456.hmmer
Best: 27  
Pass:110

Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:

+ I Cache Size should most probably be at least 32 kB.
+ D Cache Size should   definitely  be at least 64 kB.
+ L2 Cache Size  doesn't seem to have clear impact.
+ I Cache Associativity  seems to be better set at 4.
+ D Cache Associativity  seems to be better set at 4.
+ L2 Cache Associativity doesn't have clear impact.

| ranges | I_size | D_size | L2_size | I_assoc | D_assoc | L2_assoc | cache_line_size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 32kB | 64kB | 256kB | 2-way | 2-way | 4-way | 128bytes |
| | 128kB | 128kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way | 256bytes |

Explanation: In order to reduce the number of simulations, we
decided to discretize L2_cache_size, even more, by defining
three different levels: 256 kB, 1 MB and 4 MB.  
Moreover, in L1_cache_associativity, we couldn't exclude 2-way
associativity from the simulations (due to the decreased complexity).

### Benchmark 458.sjeng
Best: 6  
Pass:112

Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:

+ I Cache Size has unclear impact (seems to prefer  8 and 64kB).
+ D Cache Size has unclear impact (seems to prefer 32 and 64kB).
+ L2 Cache Size should definitely be at least 4 MB.
+ I Cache Associativity  seems to be better set at 2.
+ D Cache Associativity  seems to be better set at 4.
+ L2 Cache Associativity seems to be better set at 8.

Here, the simulations seem to be totally misleading. So, we change
the plan and we run simulations for the 6 best configurations, which
cover a  broad area of the spectrum, in order to decide about the 
cache_line_size as well. Afterwards, a 3rd total round of simulations
will be run to decide.

Selected for the next round are:

| configs | I_size | D_size | L2_size | I_assoc | D_assoc | L2_assoc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 16kB | 64kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way |
| | 64kB | 32kB | 4MB | 2-way | 4-way | 8-way |
| | 8kB | 64kB | 4MB | 2-way | 2-way | 8-way |
| | 8kB | 64kB | 4MB | 2-way | 4-way | 8-way |
| | 8kB | 32kB | 4MB | 2-way | 4-way | 8-way |
| | 64kB | 16kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way |

Explanation: In order to reduce the number of simulations, we
decided to discretize L2_cache_size, even more, by defining
threee different levels: 256 kB, 1 MB and 4 MB.
Moreover, in L1_cache_associativity, we couldn't exclude 2-way
associativity from the simulations (due to the decreasedcomplexity).

VERDICT: Cache_Line_Size of 256 bytes gives way better results.
So, this is selected for the final round and due to the unclearness
of the previous simulations the parameters for the final round are:

| ranges | I_size | D_size | L2_size | I_assoc | D_assoc | L2_assoc | cache_line_size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 8kB | 8kB | 256kB | 2-way | 2-way | 4-way | 128bytes |
| | 128kB | 128kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way | 256bytes |

Explanation: L1 cache size increases by the factor of 4 in order to
reduce the number of simulations. The same with L2 cache size.

### Benchmark 470.libm
Best: 38  
Pass:111

Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:

+ I Cache Size should most probably be at least 32 kB.
+ D Cache Size doesn't have clear impact.
+ L2 Cache Size should  definitely  be at least 4 MB.
+ I Cache Associativity  doesn't have clear impact.
+ D Cache Associativity  doesn't have clear impact.
+ L2 Cache Associativity doesn't have clear impact.

| ranges | I_size | D_size | L2_size | I_assoc | D_assoc | L2_assoc | cache_line_size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 64kB | 8kB | 1MB | 2-way | 2-way | 4-way | 128bytes |
| | 128kB | 128kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way | 256bytes |

Explanation: We simulate more values in L2 cache size parameter
although the first simulations are clear: the higher the L2 cache
size, the better the CPI. For D cache size we discretize in the
same way as before.

### Benchmark 401.bzip
Best:  1  
Pass:121  
(Best simulation is just one, so unreliable. 
 Emphasize on pass simulations.)
 
Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:

+ I Cache Size doesn't have clear impact (even 8 kB).
+ D Cache Size doesn't have clear impact (prefers > 8 kB).
+ L2 Cache Size should  definitely  be at least 4 MB.
+ I Cache Associativity  doesn't have clear impact.
+ D Cache Associativity  doesn't have clear impact.
+ L2 Cache Associativity seems to be better set at 8.

| ranges | I_size | D_size | L2_size | I_assoc | D_assoc | L2_assoc | cache_line_size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 8kB | 32kB | 1MB | 2-way | 2-way | 4-way | 128bytes |
| | 128kB | 128kB | 4MB | 4-way | 4-way | 8-way | 256bytes |

Explanation: Here, we bring back some restrictions on the simulations.
Cache sizes of 8 and 16 will be run wih associativity of 2, while
cache sizes of 32 and greater with associativity of 4. For I_size
the same discretization as before is valid.

## The Arrival

Now, we are going to repeat the process of identifying the best CPIs
in order to decide which parameter values suit best each benchmark.

Same Format as before:  
Ratios are defined as:  
+ (mentioned_value)/(other_value)
+ (first_mentioned_value)/(second_mentioned_value)  
and use the symbol R.

### Benchmark 429.mcf
Best:  60  
Pass: 148

Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:

+ I Cache Size (kB)
	+ Best Performance: 64 over 128, with R=1.50 ---
	+ Pass Performance: 64 over 128, with R=1.30 ---
+ D Cache Size (kB)
	+ Best Performance: 128 over 64, with R=1.50 ---
	+ Pass Performance: equivalent(64-128), with R=1.10  XXX
+ L2 Cache Size (MB)
	+ Best Performance: equivalent (2-4), with R=1.14  XXX
	+ Pass Performance: equivalent (2-4), with R=1.06  XXX
+ I Cache Associativity (way)
	+ Best Performance: 2 over 4, with R=1.14  ---
	+ Pass Performance: 2 over 4, with R=1.03  XXX
+ D Cache Associativity (way)
	+ Best Performance: 4 over 2, with R=2.33  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: equivalent(2-4), with R=1.00  XXX
+ L2 Cache Associativity (way)
	+ Best Performance: equivalent(4-8), with R=1.00  XXX
	+ Pass Performance: equivalent(4-8), with R=1.00  XXX
+ Cache Line Size (bytes)
	+ Best Performance: 256 over 64, with R=4.00  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: equivalent(256-128), with R=1.00 XXX

Verdict: As we can see, in the best 25% CPIs, we don't recognize any factor as the important one.
Most of them vary in 2 different values so, different configurations combined together have **very** similar results.
Taking the BEST performance into account we can see that:
+ D cache should optimally be 4-way associative	and its size should be 128 kB.
+ I cache should optimally be of size 128 kB (max) and also 2-way associative.
+ Cache Line Size of 256 bytes dominates the 64 bytes configuration.

### Benchmark 456.hmmer

Best:  8  
Pass: 72

Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:

+ I Cache Size (kB)
	+ Best Performance: 128 over anything, with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: 128 over 64, with R=1.17  XXX
+ D Cache Size (kB)
	+ Best Performance: 128 over anything, with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: 128 over 64, with R=3.80  !!!
+ L2 Cache Size (MB)
	+ Best Performance: equivalent (2-4), with R=1.00  XXX
	+ Pass Performance: equivalent (1-4), with R=1.00  XXX 
	and also 256 kB show good results as well: (256 kB - 4 MB), R=0.80
+ I Cache Associativity (way)
	+ Best Performance: equivalent(2-4), with R=1.00  XXX
	+ Pass Performance: 4 over 2, with R=1.48  ---
+ D Cache Associativity (way)
	+ Best Performance: 2 over anything, with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: 4 over 2, with R=1.57  ---
+ L2 Cache Associativity (way)
	+ Best Performance: equivalent(4-8), with R=1.00  XXX
	+ Pass Performance: 8 over 4, with R=1.12  XXX
+ Cache Line Size (bytes)
	+ Best Performance: 256 over anything, with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: 256 over anything, with R= inf  !!!

Verdict: Here the results are clearer in the best 25% of CPIs.
+ D Cache should be of size 128 kB and 4-way associative.
+ Cache Line Size shall optimally have 256 bytes.
+ L2 Cache Size has no effect (even 256 kB achieve pass performance), while the same goes with its associativity, can be 4-way or 8-way.
(The small difference in associativity is because of the 256 kB Configurations that achieve these result and clearly prefer 4-way associativity than 8.)
+ I Cache Size achieves better performance when set to 128 kB, while its associativity doesn't seem to matter. Also, 64 kB is a pass configuration as well.

### Benchmark 458.sjeng

Best:  2

Analyzing the bar plots we conclude the following:
+ I Cache Size (kB)
	+ Best Performance: 64  over anything, with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: all the following have equal   XXX appearances, seems to not have any effect:  
	AbsFreq: 8kB=15, 16kB =15, 32kB=14, 64kB=16, 128kB=16.
+ D Cache Size (kB)
	+ Best Performance: 64  over anything,with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: all the following have equal   XXX appearances, seems to not have any effect:  
	AbsFreq: 16kB =17, 32kB=19, 64kB=20, 128kB=20.

	+ Best Performance: 8 over anything, with R=1.00  XXX
	+ Pass Performance: 8 over 4, with R=1.12  XXX
+ Cache Line Size (bytes)
	+ Best Performance: 256 over anything, with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: 256 over anything, with R= inf  !!!

Verdict: Here the sample size for best performance is not large enough to judge by it, though we can select the best CPIs.  
Pass performance gives:
+ Associativities doesn't effect at all the CPI.
+ L2 Cache Size shall be set to max (4 MB).
+ Instruction and Data Cache Size in general do not have any effect, but the best CPIs were achieved with 64 kB Sizes.

### Benchmark 470.libm

+ Cache Line Size (bytes)
	+ Best Performance: 256 over anything, with R= inf  !!!
	+ Pass Performance: 256 over anything, with R= inf  !!!

Verdict: Here the sample size for best performance is not large enough to judge by it, though we can select the best CPIs.  
Pass performance gives:
+ L2 Cache Size should be set to max (4 MB). Also, though 4-way associativity yields adequate CPIs, the best ones were for 8-way.
+ Cache Line Size should be set to max (256 bytes).
+ The other parameters do not have any actual effect.

+ D Cache doesn't effect at all either with size (32, 64, 128) or associativity(2,4).
+ L2 Cache Size should be set to max:  2 MB and it should be 8-way associative.
