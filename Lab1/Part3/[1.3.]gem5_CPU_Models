There are many different gem5 InOrder CPU types, 2 of which are:

1. minor
MinorCPU processor model has a fixed pipeline, which is visualized. It is used to model processors with strict in-order execution behaviour. This processor model is not capable of multithreading, but can support it.

MinorCPU pipeline consists of:
+ Fetch1: instruction fetch responsible for fetching cache lines
+ Fetch2: line to instruction decomposition
+ Decode: instruction to micro-op decomposition
+ Encode: instruction execution and memory interface

MinorCPU cache consists of:
+ L1 for instructions
+ L1 for data
+ L2
+ WalkCache

2. hpi
HPICPU stands for High-Performance In-Order CPU. HPICPU is based on the architecture of MinorCPU adding some extra features.

HPICPU pipeline consists of:
+ Same pipeline with MinorCPU
+ Branch Prediction
+ Functional Units

HPICPU cache consists of:
+ Same cache with MinorCPU
+ Prefetcher
+ TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer), which is part of the Memory Management Unit. It consists of ITB and DTB for instructions and data respectively.
