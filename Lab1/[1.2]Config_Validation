Validation of our system's Basic Characteristics through Config.json File:

(line#)	
____	CPU type: (inside "system"->"cpus")
 439	                "type": "MinorCPU",

____	CPU Frequency: (inside "system"->"cpus")
 127	    "cpu_cluster": {
 ...
 140	        "clk_domain": {
 141		    "name": "clk_domain", 
 142		    "clock": [
 143		        250{
 144		    ], 
 ...	Until here it is set the system.cpu_cluster.clk_domain equal to 250ps
	which means that the clock frequency is set to 4 GHz.
	Afterwards (inside "system"->"cpus") every memory component frequency 
	is set to the same value: (e.g.):
 334 	                    "icache": {
 ...
 356 	                        "clk_domain": "system.cpu_cluster.clk_domain", 

____	Clock Domain: (inside "system")
  71	"clk_domain": {
  72		    "name": "clk_domain", 
  73		    "clock": [
  74		        1000
		    ], 
____	Number of Cores: (inside "system"->"cpus")
 153	            "cpus": [
 ...
 242	                    "numThreads": 1,
Q: Why only 1?
A: This processor model does not support multithreading.

____	Memory Type:(inside "system"->"cpus")
  66 	        "memories": [
  67          "system.mem_ctrls0", 
  68          "system.mem_ctrls1"
  69     ], 
 ...
1710	        "mem_ctrls": [
 ...
1723	                "tCL": 13750, 
1724	                "tCK": 1250,
 ...
1728	                "name": "mem_ctrls0", 
 ...
1790	                "devices_per_rank": 8, 
 ...
1807	                "device_bus_width": 8,
 ...
1815	                "tRCD": 13750, 
 ...
1824	                "tRP": 13750

	Likewise for mem_ctrls1.

	Q: How does this indicate a memory type of "DDR3_1600_8x8"?
	A: DDR means double data rate and 1600Mhz is the total frequency, so the single frequency is
	800Mhz. This means a clock time of "tCK"=1250 ps. As far as "tCL" is concerned, this is equivalent
	to the CAS latency of our RAM and for a DDR3_1600_8x8 it is equal to 13750. Similarly, tRCD and tRP.

____	Number of Memory Channels: (inside "system")
  66 	        "memories": [
  67          "system.mem_ctrls0", 
  68          "system.mem_ctrls1"
  69      ], 
 ...
1710	        "mem_ctrls": [
 ...
1771	                "ranks_per_channel": 2, 

____	Physical Memory Size: (inside "system")
  84	"mem_ranges": [
  85		"0:2147483647"
  86	],

____	Cache Line Size: (inside "system")
 112	        "cache_line_size": 64, 

____	Cluster Voltage: (inside "system->"cpu cluster")
 127        "cpu_cluster": {
