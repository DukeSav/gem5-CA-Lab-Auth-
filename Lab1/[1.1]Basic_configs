Basic Parameters (the arguments provided to Gem5):
	1. Commands to run
	2. CPU type: 		'atomic', 'minor', or 'hpi'.
		The default value is 'atomic', which has no pre-defined cache-level memory.
	3. CPU frequency
	4. Number of cores
	5. Memory type
	6. Number of memory channels	
	7. Number of memory ranks per channel
	8. Physical memory size

Our system's Basic Characteristics:
	1.-
	2. CPU type: 'minor', 
	which implements the following pre-defined cache-level memory in our system:
		a.L1I (1st level cache memory for Instructions)
		b.L1D (1st level cache memory for Data)
		c.L2  (2nd level cache memory, usually not split)
		d.walk-cache (works as AddressSpaceIDentifier and VirtualMachineIDentifier)
	3. CPU frequency: 4 GHz
	4. Clock Domain: 1 GHz
	5. Number of cores: 1
