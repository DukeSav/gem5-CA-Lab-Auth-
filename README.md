## Lab1

### [1.1]Basic_configs
This file consists of two basic ideas based on `starter_se.py`:
+ System's Basic Parameters are defined.
+ System's Basic Characteristics are reported and explained.

### [1.2]Config_Validation
This file reports all Basic Characteristics mentioned in [1.1] based on the `config.json` file created by gem5, thus validating them.
