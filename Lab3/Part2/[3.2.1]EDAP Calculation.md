## Area
Area is simply given by McPAT. We simply add:  
CPU_Area + L2_Area

## Delay
CPI is considered an adequate metric for the delay of our system. CPI characterises the whole system, hence we will be using it in both the CPU and L2 as is.

## Energy
Energy is extracted by the McPAT output. By adding: 
Total_Power_Consumption = Runtime_Dynamic + Subthreshold_Leakage + Gate_Leakage

These parameters are calculated in Watts,
but we need to have the energy.
To calculate this we simply multiply the total power consuption (Watts)
to the total execution time given by the gem5.

So the total energy is:  
Total_Energy = Total_Power_Consumption * Total_Time
