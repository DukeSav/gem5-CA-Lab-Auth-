If we consider a metric of Eout/Ein, where Ein is the same for each CPU.  
Eout is Ein - PowerConsumption*TimeTask  
So if the PowerConsumption*TimeTask is smaller the specified CPU is considered the more energy efficient.

The second CPU has a much higher Power Consumption, thus need a much lower task time to be more energy efficient. Task time is related to CPU Performance(frequency, core count, cache configuration etc.).

Even though McPAT provides us with power consumption, it does not provide us with task completion time. Consequently we cannot conclude which CPU is more energy efficient.
