If we consider a metric of Eout/Ein, where Ein is the same for each CPU.  
Eout = Ein - PowerConsumption * TimeTask  
So if the PowerConsumption * TimeTask is smaller, the specified CPU is considered the more energy efficient.

In the given case, the second CPU has a much higher Power Consumption, thus need a much lower task time to be more energy efficient than the first one. Task time is related to CPU Performance(frequency, core count, cache configuration etc.).
So, it is deemed possible that the second CPU is more energy efficient, thus having a higher battery life.

Even though McPAT provides us with power consumption, it does not provide us with task completion time. Consequently we cannot conclude which CPU is more energy efficient.
